Telepathy	Orders, Rank 5	Standard	None	Permanent	None	20	The character dominates a target with whom they've established a Telepathic Link and who has no Focus left. The character makes a Logic check with trouble against the target's Logic defense. On a success, the target is completely dominated and will follow the character's orders. On a Fantastic success, the character gains an edge the next time they use this power against this same target. The result of the character's check is the target number for any attempts by the target to end the domination. If any order involves harming someone, the target gets to make a Logic check to end the domination. If the target has the Heroic tag, they get an edge on the check. If the order would cause the target to harm themselves, the target gets an edge on the check. If they have the Heroic tag, they get a double edge.	5
Elemental Protection 4	The character's elemental protection is like a fortress.	Elemental Control	Elemental Protection 3, Rank 5	Standard/Reaction	The character is attacked or otherwise in danger.	Concentration	None	20	The character protects themselves with their element. Any attacks against them that do 40 points of damage or less are instantly absorbed, and the protection continues. If an attack does more than 40 points of damage, it destroys the protection. Either way, the character remains unharmed.	5
Possession	The character takes over someone else's body.	Magic	Cursed, Rank 5	Standard	None	Concentration	None	20	The character makes an Ego check with trouble against the Ego defense of a character who has no Focus left. On a success, the character takes over the target's body completely. The character's Ego defense is the target number for any checks to end the possession. If the character attempts to harm someone with the possessed body, the target gets to make an Ego check to end the possession. If the target has the Heroic tag, they get an edge on the check. If the character attempts to harm the possessed body, the target gets an edge on the check. If they have the Heroic tag, they get a double edge.	5
Telekinetic Protection 4	The character's mind protects them like a fortress.	Telekinesis	Telekinetic Protection 3, Rank 5	Standard/Reaction	The character is attacked or otherwise in danger.	Concentration	None	20	The character's personal telekinetic ifeld protects them. Any attacks against them that do 40 points of damage or less are instantly absorbed, and the protection continues. If an attack does more than 40 points of damage, it destroys the protection. Either way, the character remains unharmed.	5
Telepathic Possession	The character mentally takes over someone else’s body.	Telepathy	Orders, Rank 5	Standard	None	Concentration	None	20	The character possesses a target with whom they've established a Telepathic Link and who has no Focus left. The character makes a Logic check with trouble against the target's Logic defense. On a success, the character takes over the target's body completely. The result of the character's check is the target number for any attempts by the target to end the possession. If the character attempts to harm someone with the possessed body, the target gets to make a Logic check to end the possession. If the target has the Heroic tag, they get an edge on the check. If the character attempts to harm the possessed body, the target gets an edge on the check. If the target has the Heroic tag, they get a double edge. This power can also be used to transfer the character's mind into an empty-minded target—like a fresh clone or android—permanently. This requires no check, as there is no one in the body to challenge the character's action.	5
Charmed Life	The character seems like they were born lucky	Luck	Rank 4	None	None	Permanent	None	0	The character gains an edge on any single action check each round. This does not stack with any other edges. 	4
Copy Psyche	The character can move whole minds around.	Telepathy	Information Upload, Rank 4	Standard	None	Instant	None	15	The character can copy the mind of a person with whom they have established a telepathic link and store it in their own mind. This power can also be used to transmit a mind- either theirs or a stored copy of someone elses'— into the mind of another person with whom they've established a telepathic link. Additionally, it can be used to erase a copy of a mind from a person's brain. A character can hold up to one extra mind in their head for every rank the character has. The person whose mind was copied suffers no il effects.  The character can have conversations with the minds stored in their head, and the guest minds can try to influence the character's decisions and actions. If the character wants to know something that's in a guest mind, they can use the  Mind Reading power on it. However, they don't have to ifrst establish a telepathic link to do so. At the end of every day that a character has more than one mind in their head, they must make a Resilience vs. TN 10 action check. If they fail, they lose 5 Focus.  This Focus cannot be regained until the character gets rid of any extra minds. It may take a while, but eventually, the character is sure to wind up demoralized until they rid themselves of any extra minds.  If a character with extra minds in their head wants to remove an extra mind, they can make a Logic check against the mind's Logic defense. If they succeed, they permanently delete the copied mind from their brain. If they fail, they lose 5 Focus.  When a character with extra minds in their head is demoralized, any mind inside them can attempt to take over their body. To do so, the mind must make a Logic check against the character's Logic defense. On a success, the mind gains control of the character's body. (If more than one mind tries this at once, the highest result prevails.) On a Fantastic success, the mind takes over the target's body with the body's Focus fully restored.  If a target does not want to have an extra mind placed in their head in the ifrst place, the target must ifrst be demoralized before the attempt is made. Then the character using this power must make a Logic check against the target's Logic defense. On a success, the new mind is copied over. On a Fantastic success, the mind takes over the target's body with the body's Focus fully restored.  If a body is taken over in this way, the original mind remains and cannot be removed. It can try to take over its body again if the new controller of the body becomes demoralized. If a character with extra minds in their head is shattered, all extra minds in it are permanently lost, in addition to the regular effects.  In the case of the Krakoan resurrection protocols, Cerebro si used to copy a character's entire mind. It then stores the mind in a device designed by Forge. Any telepath with this power can copy a stored mind and transmit it into a fresh clone of the body from which it emerged, effectively resurrecting that character.	4
Cosmic Awareness	The character can detect details about things anywhere in the universe	Sixth Sense	Microscopic Awareness, Rank 4	Standard	None	Concentration	Unlimited	15	The character can sense selected things at any distance from them, as long as they are in the same universe as what they are attempting to detect. This can include the location, relative velocity and overall emotional and physical status of any item, creature, or group known to the character.	4
Cure-All	The character can cure what ails you... mostly	Healing	Healing hands, Rank 4	Standard	None	Instant	Reach	15	With a touch, the character can cure any temporary ailments a target suffers from. The character makes an Ego vs. TN 12 action check. On a success, the effects of the ailment end immediately. On a  Fantastic success, treat the result like a recovery check, and the target gains back that much of any Health and Focus lost to the condition.  This can affect conditions including ablaze, bleeding, blinded, corroding, deafened, demoralized, paralyzed, poisoned and unconscious. If the target was demoralized, they now have 1 Focus, and if the target was unconscious, they now have 1 Health. (They can have more if the character got a Fantastic success and recovered more for them.)  Note that this only works on acute conditions and diseases, those the target has contracted recently and that would-under ideal circumstances-resolve soon, leaving them alive. It does not affect chronic or permanent diseases or serious diseases that are likely to be fatal.  For instance, it can cure temporary deafness but not permanent deafness. It can stop an allergy attack but not the allergies themselves. It can cure poison but not cancer. It has no effect against the Techno-Organic virus, the Transmode virus, the Legacy virus or other such diseases.	4
Danger Sense	The character can feel danger on the way.	Sixth Sense							Even if the character doesn't get a Fantastic result on their initiative check, they get a turn during the bonus round of any combat they are in. This works even if no one else in the combat can act in the bonus round.	???
Detect Lie	The character can tell if you're telling the truth.	Translation							When someone communicates in an active form the character can understand-verbally, telepathically, using sign language and so on—the character can make an Ego check against the communicator's Ego defense. On a success, the character knows if the communicator is lying.   On a Fantastic success, they also know (if possible) why the communicator is lying.  This power does not allow the character to know the truth, although they may be able to ifgure it out by detecting lies. Also, it only works on communicators who know they are lying. If they believe what they are saying- even if it is wrong—no lie can be detected.	???
Detect Supers	The character can sense super-powered people.	Sixth Sense							The character can sense anyone within a certain distance of them who has super-powers. This reveals a count of the number of people who have powers and their rough distance and direction from the character. It doesn't supply any other information, like name, appearance, the type of powers and so on.  Note that powers that can be picked by someone with the Special Training origin are not considered super-powers.  When the character picks this power, they have two options. They can take the power as it is, or they can limit it to detecting powers from a single origin, like Mutant or Alien (including All subtypes). If they take the regular power, its range is 5 miles.   If they take a limited power, its range is 25 miles. For example, the character can have Detect Supers with a range of 5 miles or Detect Supers: Mutants with a range of 25 miles.	???
Evil Eye	The character can inflict trouble on those who cross their path.	Luck							The character picks a foe in their line of sight. That foe has trouble on all action checks made for the power's duration. There is no limit on the range between the character and the foe once the power is activated. The character must pay the Focus cost at the start of each of their subsequent turns of concentration to keep the power working.	???
Healing Hands	The character has a healing touch.	Healing							The character can heal a target creature with a touch. For every point of Focus the character spends, the target regains a point of Health, up to their maximum score. The character must spend at least 10 Focus to use the power. Any Health points that would have been healed beyond the target's maximum Health are lost.	???
Indecipherable	The character has a language all their own.	Translation							The character has constructed an internal language that only they can understand. They think in this language entirely, and when they communicate with others, they are translating from that language.   This effectively renders them immune to telepathic powers like Mind Reading or Mind Interrogation, as anyone trying to read their mind cannot understand this unique language.	???
Intuition	The character has a bad feeling about this.	Sixth Sense							When faced with a decision, the character can get a feeling about which choice would be best for them in the long run. When activating this power, the player presents the choice to the Narrator, and the Narrator tells them which choice the intuition is leading the character toward.  Characters should take care when using this power. What is best for them might not be best for the rest of the team or anyone else they care about. Also, what's best in the long run might not be best for the character in the short run. In fact, what's best is often up for interpretation.	???
Jinx You	The character can hit you with a jinx.	Luck							The character makes a Melee check to touch the target. On a success, the power takes effect, and that foe has trouble on All action checks made for the power's duration. On a Fantastic success, the target also takes standard (not doubled) Melee damage.  The character must pay the Focus cost at the start of each of their subsequent turns of concentration to keep the power working.	???
Jinx You All	The character can jinx a whole group of foes at once.	Luck							The character picks up to one foe per rank in their line of sight. Those foes have trouble on all action checks made for the power's duration. There is no limit on the range from the character to their foes once the power is activated.  The character must pay the Focus cost at the start of each of their subsequent turns of concentration to keep the power working.	???
Let's Go	The character can get a friend back on their feet.	Healing							The character can eliminate the effects of a target losing all of their Health. Rather than falling unconscious, the target remains awake and mobile. They can use movement actions but not reactions or standard actions.  This does not protect a character from death. They can be killed normally, and this power cannot bring back a dead character.  Once the power takes effect, the target does not have to remain within the character's reach. When the effect ends, if the target has 0 Health or less, they become unconscious. If the target's Health rises above 0 at any point, this power automatically ends.	???
Lucky Me		Luck							The character gains an edge on all action checks made while this power is in effect. The character must pay the Focus cost at the start of each of their subsequent turns of concentration to keep the power working.	???
Lucky Us		Luck							The character picks up to one ally in their line of sight per the character's rank. The character and those allies gain an edge on all action checks made while this power si in effect. There si no limit on the range from the character to their allies once the power is activated.  The character must pay the Focus cost at the start of each of their subsequent turns of concentration to keep the power working.	???
Lucky You		Luck							The character touches an ally. That ally gains an edge on all action checks made while this power is in effect.	???
Microscopic Awareness		Sixth Sense							The character can see and identify items that would normally require a microscope to detect, much less comprehend. This includes things like ifngerprints, a single strand of hair and even a person's DNA. In the case of DNA, the character can use this to identify a person and link them to close relatives with similar DNA.	???
Never Surrender		Healing							The character can eliminate the effects of a target losing all of their Focus. Rather than becoming demoralized, the target can function normally without having trouble on all their actions due to their lack of Focus. They cannot spend more Focus, though, and they can still be shattered.  Once the power takes effect, the target does not have to remain within the character's reach. When the effect ends, if the target has 0 Focus or less, they become demoralized.  If the target's Focus rises above 0 at any point, this power automatically ends.	???
Postcognition 1		Sixth Sense							The character can sense what happened to a particular person, place or item within their reach— including themselves—in the past six hours.  If using the power to analyze a person, they sense the events from the person's point of view, using that person's senses. If the person is unconscious, dead or otherwise senseless at any point during that time, the character cannot sense anything at those points either.  If using the power to analyze a place, the character can sense everything that happened in that place over that period of time, using their own senses. It seems to the character as if they are standing in their current location and position.  If using the power to analyze an item, the character senses how the item was affected or used over that period of time, no matter where it was located or how it moved. They can sense things as if the item had their senses.  The character can fast-forward and rewind through the period of time and stop at interesting parts, allowing them to play out in real time.	???
Postcognition 2		Sixth Sense							The character can sense what happened to a particular person, place or item within their reach— including themselves—in the past 24 hours. Otherwise, this power works the same as Postcognition 1.	???
Postcognition 3		Sixth Sense							The character can sense what happened to a particular person, place or item within their reach- including themselves-in any 24-hour period in the past year. Otherwise, this power works the same as Postcognition 1	???
Postcognition 4		Sixth Sense							The character can sense what happened to a particular person, place or item within their reach—including themselves—in any week-long period in the past century. Otherwise, this power works the same as Postcognition 1	???
Power Slider		Power Control	Rank 3						The character has a single criterion that affects the strength of their powers on a spectrum. The character starts of normal, but they can become boosted or dampened from there. When things are going well for the character, all of their other powers are boosted. If the powers have ranges or effective areas or durations, these are doubled.   If the powers affect damage multipliers, add 1 to the effects. Any effects that normally happen on a Fantastic success automatically happen on any success, not just a Fantastic one. Also, anything that would dampen their powers only brings them back to normal.  When things are going poorly for the character, all of their other powers are dampened. If the powers have ranges or effective areas or durations, these are halved.  If the powers affect damage multipliers, subtract 1 from the effects. The power can no longer enjoy Fantastic successes. Also, anything that would boost their powers only brings them back to normal.  These effects last for a single combat or—if they happen outside of combat—a single day.  Here are three criteria to pick from: conifdence, faith and media popularity. With the Narrator's consent, players can come up with others. • Conifdence: If the character gets a Fantastic success on an important action check, their conifdence soars, and their powers are boosted. If the character fails an important action check, their conifdence falls, and their powers are dampened. • Faith: If something the character believes as a core part of their faith is shown to be true, their faith soars and their powers are boosted. If something the character believes as a core part of their faith is shown to be doubtful, their faith falls, and their powers are dampened. • Media Popularity: If the character's media ratings substantially rise (more people watch their shows), their powers are boosted. If the character's media ratings substantially fall (fewer people watch their shows), their powers are dampened.  The criteria in question may go up and down often, seeming to leave the character to the whims of fate, but ignore minor changes. Only something that feels like a special moment should cause a change.  Players may be tempted to set up their characters to constantly succeed. If this happens, Narrators should remember that they can often tip matters ni the other direction. The swinging back and forth makes things more fun than keeping them always on an even keel.	3
Precognition 1		Sixth Sense							The character gains a sense of what is going to happen to a particular person, place or item within their reach-including themselves—in the next 24 hours. The further out any particular future is, the harder it is for the character to be certain about elements of that future. However, they can sense broad paths. Especially perilous or likely (or worse, both) possibilities often stand out like beacons in the night.  The player can ask the Narrator a single question about the day ahead and get an honest answer based upon what the Narrator thinks is most likely to happen. The Narrator should give short and direct answers without detailed explanations. It is perfectly fine for the answer to be cryptic and to leave the player with more questions than they started with.  These answers do not dictate what is fated to happen. They only give hints as to possible futures. The choices the players make and the chances they take have a tremendous impact upon these outcomes.  Terribly unlikely things happen all the time, which means that the character's sense of the future is not infallible. However, they are rarely outright wrong.  This is a great power for a character the Narrator controls. They can use it to lead the players around, give them guidance, and perhaps even set them up for a horrible betrayal. The characters, of course, don't have to believe what a precognitive character tells them and might even openly defy their advice.  However, this can be an incredibly challenging power to handle as a player. The Narrator shouldn't spoon-feed details to the player. They should answer the player's questions in generalities when possible and not offer extra details. If the player isn't concerned enough about something to ask about it, then it doesn't occur to the character to consider that particular aspect of the future either.  If appropriate, the Narrator can state that the future is too uncertain to be determined at any particular moment. This often happens at climactic moments when there are too many possible futures to consider. or when the ones available are equally likely to happen. The Narrator should use this option judiciously, though. If the character can't ever effectively use their power, that's a sure road to frustration.  The Narrator can also present the character with visions that the character didn't ask for. These often happen when something vitally important is destined (or at least likely) to occur that can negatively affect the character or people they care about. This could be a personal crisis or a disaster that's bound to catch the character up in it. Such visions still cost Focus. They drain the character, even if they were not requested. 	???
Precognition 2		Sixth Sense							The character gains a sense of what is going to happen to a particular person, place or item within their reach-including themselves—in the next week. Otherwise, this power works the same as Precognition 1  Alternatively, the character can consider the fate of something within a mile of their location (rather than within their reach) over the next 24 hours. The character simply closes their eyes and thinks about the thing in question, which must be something they already know about.	???
Precognition 3		Sixth Sense							The character gains a sense of what si going to happen to a particular person, place or item within their reach-including themselves-in the next month. Otherwise, this power works the same as Precognition 1.  Alternatively, the character can consider the fate of something within a mile of their location (rather than within their reach) over the next week, or something within 100 miles of their location over the next 24 hours. The character simply closes their eyes and thinks about the thing in question, which must be something they already know about.	???
Precognition 4		Sixth Sense							The character gains a sense of what is going to happen to a particular person, place or item within their reach-including themselves—in the next year. Otherwise, this power works the same as Precognition 1.  Alternatively, the character can consider the fate of something within a mile of their location (rather than within their reach) over the next month, or something within 100 miles of their location over the next week, or something within 1,000 miles of their location over the next 24 hours. The character simply closes their eyes and thinks about the thing in question, which must be something they already know about. 	???
Real Jinx		Luck							All characters who attempt to harm the character by direct action have trouble on their action checks. This does not stack with any other trouble.	???
Restore		Healing							The character can bring a target back from being shattered. To attempt this, the character makes an Ego vs. TN 20 action check. On a success, the target is restored to 1Focus. On a Fantastic success, the target si restored ot full Focus.  With any kind of success, the character using this power is then reduced to 1Focus. On a failure, they only have to pay the minimum cost of 20 Focus..	???
Resurrect		Healing							The character can try to bring a target back from the dead if they do so soon after the target's death. To attempt this, they must be able to touch the dead target's body, and that body must be relatively intact—at least enough so that if the person came back to life they wouldn't instantly die again.  The character makes an Ego check against a TN equal to 10 plus 1for every hour the target has been dead. For example, if the target has been dead for four hours, the TN is 14. On a success, the target is restored to 1 Health.   On a Fantastic success, the target is restored to full Health. With any kind of success, the character using this power si then reduced to 1 Focus. On a failure, they only have to pay the minimum cost of 20 Focus.	???
Soothing Touch		Healing							The character can restore a target creature's Focus with a touch. For every point of Focus the character spends, the target regains a point of Focus, up to their maximum score. The character must spend at least 10 Focus to use the power. Any Focus points that would have been restored beyond the target's maximum Focus are lost. 	???
Swap Items		Teleportation							The character swaps items they possess with the items of another person they can see within 2 spaces per the character's rank. These items can include weapons, clothing or anything else that is on the other person but not attached to them. When the effect ends, the swapped items return to the people who had them originally.  The character can swap all of their possessions, or they can be as selective as they like. The items must generally be swapped on an equal basis, but it is possible to swap something for nothing. For instance, the character could swap what's in their hands for what's in the target's hands. If they are holding nothing and the target has a pistol, they can swap the pistol for nothing.  If the person being swapped with is unwilling, the character must make an Ego check against that person's Vigilance defense to succeed.	???
Swap Places		Teleportation							The character swaps places with another person they can see within 2 spaces per the character's rank. When the effect ends, the character and the other person swap places again.  If the person being swapped with is unwilling, the character must make an Ego check against that person's Vigilance defense to succeed.	???
Swap Powers		Power Control							The character makes an Ego attack against a target they can see within 2spaces per the character's rank. If the target's powers have costs, the character must pay the highest of them, or a minimum of 10 Focus.  On a success, they swap al of their non-Swap powers with the target's powers. Both characters can now use their new powers as if they had always had them. When either character uses a swapped power, they must pay any cost for it normally as well.	???
Swap Status		Teleportation							 The character swaps status with a target they can see within 2 spaces per the character's rank. The character can swap their entire status with the target, or they can be selective about it. Statuses they can swap include:  • Lost Health • Lost Focus • Any condition  • Occupation • Traits lags  When swapping lost Health or Focus, the character and the target each take their maximum Health or Focus and subtract from it anything that the other person has lost at that moment. The same thing happens when the effect ends. This could potentially kill or shatter someone, so the character should be careful when doing this.  Example: Escapade has taken 50 points of Health damage, and she swaps her lost Health status with an A.I.M. agent who is unharmed. This brings Escapade's Health back up to full, but the A.I.M. agent only has 10 Health to start with. Taking on her lost 50 Health would kill him. However, Escapade is Heroic, so the Holding Back rules in the Core Rulebook would leave the A.I.M. agent with 9- Health instead, 1 point away from dying.  When swapping occupations, the character gains the target's position, including their authority and their responsibilities. For instance, if the character swaps occupations with the ruler of a nation, others recognize them as being the ruler for as long as the effect continues. When the effect ends, any alterations that have happened to either character swap back to the other. For instance, if one of the characters is killed while the other lives, that would swap when the effect ends. For this reason alone, characters should take extreme care with this power.	???
Understand Body Language		Translation							When the character encounters a culture for the first time, they can make a Logic vs. TN 13 action check to puzzle out its body language. If they already know any other version of the culture's language, they have an edge. On a success, they understand and can emulate the body language. On a Fantastic success, they permanently understand and can use it and never need to make a check for it again.  This covers not only any potential full-body language used by an alien species but also the body language of species that use other forms of communication. With such species, understanding their body language allows the character to understand more than the target's words might communicate, such as whether a person is aggressive, shy, anxious, reckless and so on.	???
Understand Code		Translation							When the character encounters an unknown code for the first time, they can make a Logic vs. TN 13 action check to puzzle it out. If they already know any other version of the language the code is based on, they have an edge. On a success, they understand and can communicate in the code. On a Fantastic success, they permanently understand and can use it and never need to make a check for it again. Digital data communication is considered a form of code, and the character can use this power to understand such data too.	???
Understand Sign Language		Translation							When the character encounters an unknown sign language for the first time, they can make a Logic vs. TN 13 action check to puzzle it out. If they already know any other version of the language, they have an edge. On a success, they understand and can sign in the language. On a Fantastic success, they permanently understand and can use it and never need to make a check for it again.	???
Understand Spoken Language		Translation							When the character encounters an unknown spoken language for the first time, they can make a Logic vs. TN 13 action check to puzzle it out. If they already know any other version of the language, they have an edge. On a success, they understand and can speak the language. On a Fantastic success, they permanently understand and can speak it and never need to make a check for it again.	???
Understand Unusual Communication		Translation							When the character encounters an unknown form of communication for the first time-one that doesn't depend on hearing, vision or code-they can make a Logic vs. TN 13 action check to puzzle it out. If they already know any other version of the communication, they have an edge. On a success, they understand and can use that form of communication. On a Fantastic success, they permanently understand and can use it and never need to make a check for it again.  This works with forms of communication that include other senses, like scent, touch, taste and so on.	???
Understand Written Language		Translation							When the character encounters an unknown written language for the first time, they can make a Logic vs. TN 13 action check to puzzle it out. If they already know any other version of the language, they have an edge. On a success, they can read and write the language. On a Fantastic success, they can permanently read and write it and never need to make a check for it again.	???
Wish You Luck		Luck							The character picks an ally in line of sight. That ally gains anedge on all action checks made while this power is in effect. There is no limit on the range between the character and the ally once the power is activated.  The character must pay the Focus cost at the start of each of their subsequent turns of concentration to keep the power working.	???
